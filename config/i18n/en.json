Other types of chests will be available at a higher price and in smaller quantities at a later date",

Having purchased the NFT Chest at mint, you will receive a NEAR NFT representing this particular chest.\n\n## How to use?\n\nAny chest can be opened in the game at Global Launch date or re-sold anytime on Paras Marketplace now or in-game p2p NFT Market later.\n\n## Why buy now?\n\nNFT Chests pre-sale amounts will be limited to the drops stated in Roadmap. Every next pre-sale, the price of previous unsold chests (if there are any) will be increased. A new type of greater chests will be added every next presale. We are planning to complete all pre-sales before Global Launch, so the only way to obtain NFT Chests after Global Launch  will be to buy them from other people on the secondary market.\n\nNFT- items obtained from the Chests would be much more expensive after the game release date, as well as other NFT-items in the game, due  to their unique performance characteristics and limited supply."
